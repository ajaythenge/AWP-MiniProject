                        Outriders is an online-only cooperative action role-playing third-person video game developed by People Can Fly and published by Square Enix's European subsidiary. It was released on April 1, 2021 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
                        One, Xbox Series X/S, and Stadia. The game received mixed reviews from critics, with praise towards the gameplay, customization, and visuals, but criticism for the story and characters. Outriders is a third-person shooter mixed
                        with elements from role-playing games. In the beginning of the game, players create their custom characters and choose from four classes, each of them with unique abilities that the players can use. The four classes include the
                        Trickster, which has the ability to manipulate time, the Pyromancer, which can manipulate fire, the Devastator, which can unleash seismic attacks, and the Technomancer, which uses turrets and other devices. These special skills
                        have a short cooldown time and can be combined with other skills for maximum effects. The game features a skill tree that allows players to unlock and upgrade their skills.

                        Humankind is a turn-based strategy 4X video game by Amplitude Studios and published by Sega. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Stadia in August 2021. It received generally favorable reviews. Humankind is a 4X game comparable to the Civilization
                        series. Players lead their civilization across six major eras of human civilization, starting from the nomadic age, directing how the civilization should expand, developing cities, controlling military and other types of units
                        as they interact with other civilizations on the virtual planet, randomly generated at the start of a new game. A distinguishing feature of Humankind is that within each of the eras, the player selects one of ten civilization types
                        based on historical societies; this selection offers both bonuses and penalties to how the player can build out the civilization. Because a player can select different civilizations as templates to build upon, there exist potentially
                        one million different civilization patterns that a player can ultimately develop.

                        Call of Duty: Vanguard is a 2021 first-person shooter game developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision. It was released on November 5 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It serves as the
                        18th installment in the overall Call of Duty series. It establishes a storyline featuring the birth of the special forces to face an emerging threat at the end of the war during various theatres of World War II.The game received
                        mixed reviews from critics, with praise towards the campaign and multiplayer, but criticism for its Zombies mode and lack of innovation. Vanguard's campaign features similar gameplay mechanics previously introduced in Modern Warfare,
                        such as the player being able to mount wielded weapons to flat surfaces, interact with doors and execute takedowns. New gameplay features allow the player the ability to use a more advanced tactical approach in combat such as blind
                        firing from behind cover, breaking through destructible environmental elements or creating new paths to complete objectives by climbing walls

                    <div class="gamedata1">
                        Like past Halo games, Halo Infinite is a shooter with most gameplay taking place from a first-person perspective. Players use a number of weapons and vehicles commonly found in the Halo series, such as the Warthog. The game features several new abilities
                        for player characterthe Master Chief, such as the Grapple Shot and Thruster, which enables him to pull himself towards foes or retrieve items. The title's campaign mode features a semi-open world structure; players can freely explore
                        parts of the setting, the ringworld Zeta Halo, which are segmented off from each other and initially impassable. Scattered throughout the environment are Forward Operating Bases, which can be cleared of enemies and captured. Captured
                        bases to traditional Halo mission design. These "dungeons" advance the story, and cannot be replayed once completed.Scattered collectibles such as audio logs provide additionalstory details. Multiplayer largely retains traditional
                        Halo gameplay, with slayer, capture the flag, and other modes available in standard 4v4 and Big Team Battle variants; the latter is 12v12.
